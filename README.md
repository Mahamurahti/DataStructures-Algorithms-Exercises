Write a stack that is based on a one-way linked list.

## Queue (Exercise 2)
Write a queue that is based on a one-way linked list.

## Sorting Algorithms (Exercise 3)
Compare select sort, merge sort and quick sort by counting the number of comparisons they do with different lengths of input.

## Binary Tree Orders (Exercise 4)
Name all the nodes in order, post order and pre order.
